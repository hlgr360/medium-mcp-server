# Contributing to Medium MCP Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Medium MCP Server! This project helps developers interact with Medium through browser automation since Medium's API is no longer available for new users.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- **Bug Reports**: Use GitHub Issues with detailed reproduction steps
- **Feature Requests**: Describe the use case and expected behavior
- **Questions**: Check existing issues first, then open a new discussion

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medium-mcp-server.git
   cd medium-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Build and Test**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   node test-browser.js  # Test browser automation
   ```

### Code Contributions

#### Before You Start
- Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplication
- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
- Follow the existing code style and patterns

#### Development Guidelines

**Browser Automation (Playwright)**
- Use robust selectors that won't break with minor UI changes
- Add fallback selectors for critical functionality
- Test with both headless and headed modes
- Handle timeouts gracefully

**TypeScript Standards**
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Add proper type definitions for all functions
- Document complex logic with comments
- Follow existing naming conventions

**Error Handling**
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle Medium's rate limiting gracefully
- Log errors appropriately (use `console.error` for MCP compatibility)
- Add retry logic for transient failures

**Testing**
- Test your changes with real Medium interactions
- Verify session persistence works correctly
- Test both login and non-login scenarios
- Check that MCP tools return proper JSON responses

#### Code Style
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- 2-space indentation
- Semicolons required
- Use async/await over Promises
- Descriptive variable and function names

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add/update tests as needed
   - Update README if adding new features

3. **Test Thoroughly**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Test your changes with actual Medium interactions
   # Verify MCP integration works in Claude
   ```

4. **Commit with Clear Messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add article tagging support"
   git commit -m "fix: handle Medium login timeout gracefully"
   git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
   ```

5. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   - Use the GitHub PR template
   - Describe what you changed and why
   - Include screenshots for UI-related changes
   - Reference any related issues

### Common Contribution Areas

**High Impact Contributions**
- **Selector Updates**: When Medium changes their UI
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery
- **Performance**: Faster browser automation
- **Documentation**: Clearer setup and troubleshooting guides

**Feature Ideas**
- Support for Medium publications
- Article drafts management
- Better session management
- Article analytics retrieval
- Bulk operations

### Medium-Specific Considerations

**Browser Automation Challenges**
- Medium frequently updates their UI selectors
- Anti-automation detection requires careful handling
- Session management across different login methods
- Rate limiting and respectful usage

**Testing with Medium**
- Use a test Medium account for development
- Be respectful of Medium's servers during testing
- Don't spam or create excessive test content
- Test with different article types and lengths

### Code Review Process

**What We Look For**
- ✅ Code works with current Medium website
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ TypeScript types are correct
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing MCP tools
- ✅ Documentation is updated
- ✅ Follows project conventions

**Review Timeline**
- Initial response: 1-3 days
- Full review: 1-2 weeks
- Complex features may take longer

### Getting Help

**Stuck on Something?**
- Check the troubleshooting section in README
- Look at existing code for patterns
- Open a draft PR with questions
- Ask in GitHub Discussions

**Communication**
- Be respectful and constructive
- Provide context and examples
- Share error logs and reproduction steps
- Be patient with review feedback

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Key Components
